To handle ball movement and collision detection in a simple 2D environment, such as a game, we can use JavaScript to update the position of the ball and check for collisions with the boundaries of the playing area. Below is a basic example of how this could be implemented using JavaScript.


Summary:
- We have a `ball` object that represents the ball with properties for its position, radius, speed, and color.
- The `drawBall` function is used to draw the ball on the canvas.
- The `updateBallPosition` function updates the ball's position based on its speed and checks for collisions with the boundaries of the canvas. If a collision is detected, it reverses the direction of the ball.
- The `startAnimation` function sets up an interval to repeatedly call `updateBallPosition`, creating the animation effect.

The approach taken here is to create a simple physics loop that updates the position of the ball and checks for collisions with the boundaries of the canvas. This is a common pattern for simple 2D games and animations. The `setInterval` function is used to create a game loop that updates the ball's position at a fixed interval, simulating continuous movement.
