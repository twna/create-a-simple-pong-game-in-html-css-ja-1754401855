To handle paddle movement in a game (such as Pong), you typically need to listen for user input (like keyboard events) and then update the paddle's position on the screen accordingly. Below is an example of how you might write JavaScript to handle paddle movement using keyboard events.


**Summary:**
The JavaScript code provided adds an event listener for the `keydown` event to the document. When the user presses the up or down arrow keys, the paddle's position is updated. The `movePaddle` function changes the `paddleY` variable by a `deltaY` amount, which is then applied to the paddle's `top` style property to move it on the screen. The paddle's movement is constrained to the window's height to prevent it from moving off-screen.

**Reasoning:**
The approach taken ensures that the paddle can be moved by the user using the keyboard's arrow keys, providing a simple and intuitive control scheme. The paddle's movement is constrained within the bounds of the game area to maintain gameplay integrity. Adjusting the `paddleSpeed` variable allows for easy tuning of the game's difficulty.
