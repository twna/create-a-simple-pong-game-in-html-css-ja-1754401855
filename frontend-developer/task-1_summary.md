To create the HTML structure for a simple Pong game, you'll need a container for the game, a canvas where the game will be drawn, and potentially some additional elements for score display or game controls. Here's a basic structure:


Summary:
- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines the document type and version of HTML.
- The `<html>` element is the root element of an HTML page.
- The `<head>` section contains meta information about the document, such as its character set and viewport settings, as well as the title and styles.
- The `<body>` contains the visible page content, which includes a `div` element to serve as the game container.
- Inside the game container, a `<canvas>` element with a specified width and height is where the Pong game will be rendered.
- The `<style>` tag contains basic CSS to center the game on the page and give the canvas a border for visibility.
- A `<script>` tag is included at the end of the body for adding the JavaScript code that will handle the game logic.

Reasoning:
- The canvas element is used because it provides a surface where the game can be drawn using JavaScript.
- Styling is minimal to keep the focus on the game itself, but it ensures the game is centered and visible against the background.
- The script tag is included but left empty, as the actual game logic will be implemented in JavaScript and is beyond the scope of the HTML structure.
