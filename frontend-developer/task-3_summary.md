To provide you with JavaScript code for game logic, I need to know the specifics of the game you're referring to. However, I can give you a generic example of game logic for a simple turn-based game where players take turns to increase their score, and the first player to reach a score of 100 wins.

Here's a basic example of such game logic:


Summary:
This JavaScript code defines a simple game where two players take turns to increase their score. The `Game` class tracks each player's score, the current player, and the winner. The `playTurn` method adds points to the current player's score and checks for a winner. If a player reaches a score of 100 or more, they win, and the game ends. The `getScores` method returns the current scores, the current player, and the winner.

JSON checklist for the game logic:

The approach taken here is to encapsulate the game logic within a class, which is a common practice in object-oriented programming. This allows for easy tracking and manipulation of the game state. The game logic is kept simple for demonstration purposes, and you can extend or modify it to fit the specific rules and mechanics of your game.
